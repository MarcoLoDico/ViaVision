# ViaVision

Via Vision is an application with the goal of detecting different traffic features. Currently, the project is focused on detecting traffic signs and adding their position to a virtual map. Theoretically, this could be used by self driving cars, or other cars which capture images, to provide live updates to various map platforms.
